# Simple countries & cities provider (JSON)

This is a simple NodeJS app that can be used to access
[cities](https://github.com/lutangar/cities.json) and
[countries](https://github.com/annexare/Countries).

This makes it easy to use those NPM packages for example in a Java environment. It also is
possible to easily update the versions.
